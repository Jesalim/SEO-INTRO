 It is part of SEM (Search Engine Marketing) a term used to describe all marketing strategies for search.
 SEM entails both organic and paid search. With paid search, you can pay to list your website on a search engine so that your website shows up when  someone types in a specific key wird or phrase.

 ## How Search Engines Work
 Search engines have one objective to provide you with the most relevant results possible in relation to your search query.
 In order for a search engine to be able to display results when a user types in a query, they need to have an archive of available info to choose from.
 Every search engine has proprietary method for gathering and prioritizing website content.
 Regardless od specific tactics or methods used, this process is called indexing.
 Every search engine has what are referred to as bots, or
crawlers, that constantly scan the web, indexing websites for content and
following links on each webpage to other webpages. If your website has not been
indexed, it is impossible for your website to appear in the search results. Unless
you are running a shady online business or trying to cheat your way to the top of
the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), chances are your website has already been indexed.
