# SEO-INTRO
 ## what is SEO
 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - refers to techniques that help your website rank higher in organic or natural search results.
 It is part of SEM (Search Engine Marketing) a term used to describe all marketing strategies for search.
 SEM entails both organic and paid search. With paid search, you can pay to list your website on a search engine so that your website shows up when  someone types in a specific key wird or phrase.
 Organic and paid listings both appear on search engine, but displayed in different locations on the page.

 ## How Search Engines Work
 Search engines have one objective to provide you with the most relevant results possible in relation to your search query.
 In order for a search engine to be able to display results when a user types in a query, they need to have an archive of available info to choose from.
 Every search engine has proprietary method for gathering and prioritizing website content.
 Regardless od specific tactics or methods used, this process is called indexing.
 Every search engine has what are referred to as bots, or
crawlers, that constantly scan the web, indexing websites for content and
following links on each webpage to other webpages. If your website has not been
indexed, it is impossible for your website to appear in the search results. Unless
you are running a shady online business or trying to cheat your way to the top of
the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), chances are your website has already been indexed.


## What it takes To Rank
%There are essentially 3 elements that a search engine considers when determining where to list a website on the SERP : Rank, Authority & Relevance.

### Rank
Rank is the position that your website physically falls in on the SERP when a specific search query is entered.

### Authority
Search engines determine how authoritative and credible a website's content is by calculating how many inbound links (links from other websites) it has.
You can track over time how authoritative your website is by monitoring a few different metrics using tools such as HubSpot: it offers a free tool called 
<a href = "https://website.grader.com/"> Website Grader</a> which will show how many domains are linking to your website, and also provide your website's Moz Rank(MozRank is SEOmoz's general, logarithmically scaled 10-point
measure of global link authority or popularity. It is very similar in purpose to
the measures of link importance used by the search engines (e.g.,
Google's PageRank).)

### Relevance
It is one of the most critical factors of SEO. The searcdh engines not only look for certain keywords but also look for clues to determine how relevant your content is to a specific search query.
While there is no way to track how relevant your website is, there are some
SEO basics you can practice to cover your bases and make sure you are
giving the search engines every possible opportunity to consider your
website. We'll get to that in just a bit.
